CuwoCWS
=======

A test plugin that can be used to identify player on cuwo servers in CWSRestart

# Compilation

There are pre- and post-build actions set up to copy dependencies from CWSRestart to the Dependencies folder. There is also a post-build action set up to copy the plugin to *D:\Program Files (x86)\CuWo* with the required dependencies. You might need to change these directories to match your local setup.

# Usage

Compile everything and add ``'CuwoCWS'`` to your base.py
